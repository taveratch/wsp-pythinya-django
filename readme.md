## Django Framework + ReactJS
Developing website by using ReactJS on Django framework

## How does it work
`jsx` is rendered by using `react-render` which is node module, so we have to open server for rendering on `http://localhost:9090` then django will read and send the component to rendering server. The result is html text

## Installation
1. `cd render_server`
2. `npm install`
3. `node render_server.js`
4. Open new terminal session.
5. Go to project's root directory.
6. `npm install`
7. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
8. `python manage.py runserver`


## Frontend
1. Go to `http://localhost:8000/react`
